        		<h1>Hi there, I'm Xuan-Phu NGUYEN!</h1>
				<p>I'm #Geotechnical engineer at Itasca France.
          I often use #FLAC, #FLAC3D, #UDEC, #PFC, #Griddle and #Python for consulting projects,
          covering static and #dynamic analyses, in continuous and #discrete media,
          for applications in #civil engineering, #mining and #manufacturing.
        </p>
        <p>Before life at Itasca, I conducted a couple of R&D projects,
          including laboratory #experimental investigations, multi-physical and multi-scale #modelling, and #numerical simulation,
          for applications in geological #disposal of radioactive wastes, and #biobattery for in vivo implantable devices.
          Yes, the two domains seems to have nothing in common, and... that's amazing!
        </p>
        <p>I was initially specialised in structural engineering, and have designed,
          according to Eurocodes 1, 2, 3, 4 and 8, some complex civil structures,
          including concrete, steel and composite #construction.
          I also completed an MBA-style program at Ecole des Ponts Business School.
