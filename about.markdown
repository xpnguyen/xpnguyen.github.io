## About me
I'm geotechnical engineer at Itasca France. I often use FLAC, FLAC3D, UDEC,
  PFC, Griddle and Python for consulting projects, covering static and
  dynamic analyses, in continuous and discrete media, for applications in
  civil engineering, mining and manufacturing.

Before life at Itasca, I conducted a couple of R&D projects including laboratory
  experimental investigations, multi-physical and multi-scale modelling, and
  numerical simulation, for applications in geological disposal of radioactive
  wastes, and biobattery for in vivo implantable devices. Yes, the two domains
  seems to have nothing in common, and... that's amazing!

I was initially specialised in structural engineering, and have designed,
  according to Eurocodes 1, 2, 3, 4 and 8, some complex civil structures,
  including concrete, steel and composite construction. I also completed an
  MBA-style program at Ecole des Ponts Business School.
